The dataset used for this project is Myntra Fashion Product Dataset (kaggle.com). It includes thousands of fashion products, each with detailed information such as description, price, rating, brand name, and other attributes. The dataset is organized in 'dataset/' folder as follows:

Fashion Dataset v2.csv: This CSV file contains each product in a row, with various details spread across columns.
Image Folder: This folder contains two zip folders. Extract all the images and place into this image folder. Then, this folder contains sample images for each product. Each image file is named according to the corresponding product's 'p_id' value from the CSV.
